4. PURPOSE

BinaryDigit is an example domain object written in Java and accompanied
by a thorough set of JUnit tests. It is my hope that this code will be
helpful for those learning JUnit 4.x or improving their JUnit skills.

5. INSTALLING

BinaryDigit is supplied as an Eclipse project. I used Eclipse 3.6 (codename
Helios) to create this project structure. Hopefully it will work for you.
In event of difficulties getting this working with Eclipse, an Ant build
file is also provided.

I used JDK 1.6, but I would hope that this code should run under JDK 1.5 with
little or no problems.

6. THANKS

Many thanks are due to Mike Clark for his encouragement in all matters of testing.
